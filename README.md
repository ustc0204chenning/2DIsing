# 2DIsing
The two-dimensional Ising model by Monte-Carlo simulation, realized by cpp.

This is the final project of the advanced statistical mechanics course that I taught in spring semester 2019 in Nankai University. 

We follow the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis%E2%80%93Hastings_algorithm) to do the job.
